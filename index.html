        <h2>About me</h2>

        <div>

            <pre>   
                Thank you for visiting my page! My names Robert Baird-Bowlds but I 
            normally go by Logan. I was born and raised in Kentucky. Immediately 
            after graduating from high school, I left for the air force, where I served for 5 
            years. I was stationed in Davis-Monthan in Tucson, Arizona, and I worked as a 
            com/nav technician on board the EC-130H.
            </pre>
        
            <pre> 
                I separated from the air force back in 2021 and now go to school full time
            online. I'm currently living in Texas with my fianc√© as she is a drill instructor
            for the Air Force. My hobbies include, shooting, weightlifting, and video games.
            I have 2 dogs, 6 ferrets, and 2 prairie dogs, so I'm essentially a zoo owner as 
            well. I've got a only a couple of classes left until I graduate and I'm looking 
            forward to getting my career started. </pre>
